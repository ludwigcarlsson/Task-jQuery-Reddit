# Task-jQuery-Reddit
A simple application that shows the top 15 posts of a specific subreddit, in this case r/memes. It shows title, image, author and amount of upvotes. You can also click the post and be redirected to the reddit-thread.

## Usage
To run this, I recommend using VS Code with the extension LiveServer.

Clone the repository, then in VS Code rightclick the code and "Open with Live Server"
